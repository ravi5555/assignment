            <h2>Hotel Reservations</h2>
            <p class="a">Sri Lanka has an excellent range of accommodation in all price brackets, from basic beachside shacks<br> to elegant
                 colonial mansions and sumptuous five-star resorts – indeed staying in one of the country’s<br> burgeoning number of luxury hotels
                  and villas can be one of the principal pleasures of a visit to the island, if you can afford it. <br> <br> Hotels come in all 
                  shapes, sizes and prices, from functional concrete boxes to luxurious establishments that are virtual tourist attractions 
                  in <br>their own right.Some of the finest hotels (particularly in the hill country) are located in old colonial buildings, 
                  offering a wonderful taste of the<br> lifestyle and ambience of yesteryear, while the island also boasts a number of stunning
                   modern hotels, including many designed by Sri Lanka’s<br> great twentieth-century architect Geoffrey Bawa.<br><br> The coastal areas 
                   are also home to innumerable resort hotels, the majority of which –with a few honourable exceptions  are fairly bland, <br>
                   populated largely by European package tourists on full-board programmes and offering a diet of horrible buffet food and 
                   plenty of organized fun.<br> Complete your vacation with the most memorable stay. We do hotel reservations with 
                   highly accepted hotel chains in Sri Lanka. <br>These hotels have the best locations where you will never forget!</p>
